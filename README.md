# BeardedInc
This is a practice project that I did wth my friend Viktor. He did the back-end WebAPI, and database with C#, ASP.NET, SQL and I did my version of the front-end with Vue.js (vue3), Vite, CSS, HTML, Bootsrap. It's not finished, of course.
Its a SPA for beard grooming products, with separate components and routing to separate pages, and all user data and get requests for the products are stored in the store.
There is login authentication with local storage for the token.
There is an admin page where CRUD operations can be made to each product and changes are made to the DB.
Hosted locally.
I have so much more to learn...
